The MSB has over 96,000 cataloged lots of fishes (4,153,582 specimens), representing 63 families, 178 genera, and 420 species, collected between 1938 and present day. MSB fish records, available on FishNet2, include all holdings except for fishes collected on private and Tribal lands. MSB fish specimens consist of mostly cypriniform larval and adult fishes (vouchers and tissues), conserved, across taxa, in 5% buffered formalin, 70% and 95% ethanol, and frozen at -20&deg;C and -80&deg;C to maintain good examples for morphological, osteological, and genetic research. The MSB Division of Fishes does not hold holotypes and divides collections of paratypes with other permanent fish collections. Over 60,000 pages of field books and field data forms are archived in the Division. These documents are digitally captured and electronically archived in tiff files (permanent) and clean PDF files for viewing. The original field documents are maintained in acid and lignin free boxes for permanent storage. For access to and use of fish specimens, original records, and documentation, please see collection use policy.","active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"https://msb.unm.edu/divisions/fishes/index.html","catalogUrl":"http://fishnet2.net/aboutFishNet.html","accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"8827b228-5892-444f-9ce9-f1e1d97ed133","mailingAddress":{"key":11375,"address":"1 University of New Mexico, MSC 03 2020, Museum of Southwestern Biology, Division of Fishes","city":"Albuquerque","province":"New Mexico","postalCode":"87131","country":"US"},"address":{"key":11862,"country":"US"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-03-06T05:06:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146357,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"25804","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"b83e256a-4cd6-4017-8f54-d72574bba56d","firstName":"Mariel Campbell","position":"Collection Manager","areaResponsibility":"Data contact","phone":"1-505-277-7808","email":"campmlc@unm.edu","mailingAddress":{"key":11904,"city":"Albuquerque","country":"US"},"primaryInstitutionKey":"8827b228-5892-444f-9ce9-f1e1d97ed133","primaryCollectionKey":"11a76aef-1e5a-48f2-a0c4-53c994c30dfc","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2013-04-12T09:38:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"8192f4e4-c29d-4d47-8f4b-aa06c2fd2dc7","code":"CBUCES-E","name":"Colecciones Biológicas de la Universidad CES - Costal-Marine Species","description":"This collection holds specimens collected by research projects on marine-costal ecosystems, including marine algae, sponges, cnidarian, marine worms, echinoderms, molluscs, crabs, all from costal as well as oceanic environments.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_PRESERVED_ORGANISMS"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"preservationTypes":["SAMPLE_FLUID_PRESERVED"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"b59ff930-cdaa-4490-aad6-b0152e32380e","mailingAddress":{"key":11374,"address":"Calle 10A No. 22-04  ","city":"Medellín","province":"Antioquia","postalCode":".....","country":"CO"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-02-21T23:24:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146354,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"25785","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"05ab977a-4b3b-4af4-9763-a073d23a099e","firstName":"Lizette Irene Quan Young","areaResponsibility":"Collection Curator","researchPursuits":"Algae","email":"lquan@ces.edu.co","mailingAddress":{"key":24730,"address":"Calle 10A No. 22-04  ","city":"Medellín","province":"Antioquia","postalCode":".....","country":"CO"},"primaryInstitutionKey":"b59ff930-cdaa-4490-aad6-b0152e32380e","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-02-21T23:24:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"2d971c50-8665-459f-92e8-6a2ac011ae8c","code":"A","name":"Amphibia","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_PRESERVED_ORGANISMS"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"preservationTypes":["SAMPLE_FLUID_PRESERVED"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"bb75864c-c293-4a18-b949-71ce436d0a13","mailingAddress":{"key":11373,"address":"National Zoological Collection of Suriname  (NZCS), University complex Leysweg 86, Building#17","city":"Paramaribo","postalCode":"P.O.Box 9212","country":"SR"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-02-18T07:12:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146353,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"25782","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"eb379482-0327-46f4-a605-5b77a0dfa0d3","firstName":"Paul E.

In 1965 the Field Museum acquired the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Walker Museum fossil invertebrates, which more than doubled the total number of specimens in the collection.

It is an amalgamation of private donations, collections originally in other institutions, and material collected by the Museum. The Curator is assisted in collection chores by 1.5 part-time Collection Associates and about seven Curatorial Assistants (volunteers). BMSM consists mostly of Recent mollusks, with a focus on the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean. There are circa 2,500 fluid-preserved lots. Fossils represent only 5.5% of the total number of lots. Digitization of the collection started in 1997, through a MS Access-based platform. By the time of the Museum&rsquo;s first accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) (March 2010), only 27,000 lots (out of an originally estimated 120,000) had been catalogued. On that occasion, one of the &ldquo;Areas of Improvement by Next Review&rdquo; recommended by AAM&rsquo;s Accreditation Commission was that the Museum should take action to &ldquo;... further improve the documentation of collections.&rdquo; This process started in October 2012 with the inception of the first of two &ldquo;Museums for America &ndash; Collections Stewardship&rdquo; grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The catalogue resides in a dedicated server, and is backed-up daily both in-house and through a commercial service (Mozy Pro).  In 2011, BMSM incorporated about 11,000 lots from the local Florida Gulf Coast University. The decision by the FGCU administration to move the collection to the Shell Museum shows the degree of trust placed in the organization. The 10,000-lots Redfern Collection, donated in 2014, includes material illustrated in Colin Redfern&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bahamian Seashells&rdquo; books. The regional relevance of the collection is substantiated by circa 7,500 lots of marine mollusks from Sanibel and Captiva islands and neighboring areas. BMSM includes 18 primary types and 211 secondary types. Collection workers are assisted by a 4,000+ volume specialized library, high-resolution photographic equipment with digital stacking software, and other relevant tools and equipment.  Metadata are available from the Shell Museum web site at http://shellmuseum.emc2webs.com/collection/ (right) and iDigBio/Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, left) at http://ipt.idigbio.org/resource?r=bmnsm-shell. About 9,200 lots are georeferenced . The resource has been registered with GBIF, and is itself registered in GBIF as a data publisher endorsed by U.S. Geological Survey. The online identification guide &ldquo;SW Shells with Emphasis on Sanibel &amp; Captiva&rdquo;, currently covering 355 species, is based on the BMSM Collection.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_CELLS_TISSUE"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://shellmuseum.emc2webs.com/collection/","catalogUrl":"http://shellmuseum.emc2webs.com/collection/","apiUrl":"http://shellmuseum.emc2webs.com/collection/","preservationTypes":["SAMPLE_DRIED"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"262c6b69-0d4b-4963-aa55-3c6f93101816","mailingAddress":{"key":11357,"address":"3075 Sanibel-Captiva Road  ","city":"Sanibel","province":"Florida","postalCode":"33957","country":"US"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2017-09-28T00:22:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146335,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"25713","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"1aae116e-9071-49e7-88ae-716fe0d15cb4","firstName":"José H.

In an innovative approach, barcodes of aerial  insectivorous bats, an important but often undersampled component of local bat assemblages, are  collected together with species‐specific reference calls that function as acoustic vouchers for these  species. To obtain reference calls, captured and identified aerial insectivorous bats are recorded with  specialized bat detectors upon release. Representative echolocation calls can only be recorded when  bats are flying freely in an open area. This procedure prohibits the collection of a conventional museum  specimen but also provides the basis for non‐invasive acoustic studies that are rapidly becoming more  common and widespread. A barcoding approach, however, allows collecting an essential and  complementary genetic voucher for the animals. Knowledge of Neotropical bat flies is limited, thus this  barcoding study is expected to alleviate taxonomic uncertainty within this group and add substantial  new information on diversity and ecology (e.g. host specificity) of these parasites. As bat flies can spread  pathogens between individuals, our approach will also provide essential basic information for disease  ecology in bats.  *** These vouchers are currently at STRI ***","active":true,"personalCollection":true,"mailingAddress":{"key":11430,"address":"Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Apartado 0843-03092 ","city":"Balboa","province":"Ancón","postalCode":"Apartado 0843-03092","country":"PA"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2017-08-29T06:02:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146400,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"25665","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"4df3c519-da9d-48e2-a6fa-3b0d7c80d49f","firstName":"Rachel Page","position":"STRI Staff Scientitst","researchPursuits":"Behavioral ecology of Neotropical bats","email":"PageR@si.edu","mailingAddress":{"key":24669,"address":"Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Attn: Rachel Page, 9100 Panama City Place","city":"Washington","province":"DC","postalCode":"20521","country":"US"},"primaryInstitutionKey":"0f2d64f3-b817-46c0-a0f3-38e30847ebfe","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2017-08-23T05:20:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"34081c23-f070-4db9-bbc1-cc5b490ea0db","code":"NMU:Mamm","name":"Northern Michigan University Museum of Zoology, Mammal Collection","description":"This is the mammal collection of the Northern Michigan University Museum of Zoology.

The renowned Iguanodons from Bernissart, ambassadors of the Belgian science institute in Brussels, represent a natural history collection currently estimated to hold over 37 million specimens. The roots of the present day collection reach far back in history. It evolved from the Natural History collection of Karel of Lotharingen, governor of The Netherlands (1712-1780) and was part of didactic materials owned by the Central School of the City of Brussels. After the independence of Belgium, the City of Brussels donated the collection to the Belgian Government and became part of the autonomous Royal Natural History Museum in 1846, known as the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences since 1948. Fieldwork by researchers and collaborators, in Belgium and abroad, donations and purchases have been expanding the assets ever since. Data presented here are coming from the darwin database, the collection management tool of the RBINS. Today, the darwin database manages information on about 350.000 specimens stored in the institute&#39;s depositories. This number rises on a daily basis thanks to the continued efforts of curators and their adjuncts that are responsible for maintaining the stored specimens and information. Our online database provides information about the collections of the Vertebrates, Invertebrates, Entomology and Paleobotany. The application will soon be expanded with paleontozoological data. The Department of Geology and the Department of Marine Ecosystems provide information on different systems. More information on these departments can be found on www.sciencesnaturelles.be/institute/structure/geology/gsb_website and www.mumm.ac.be The corner stone of the darwin database is the specimen and the information about its origin and its status. Although the status of the specimens sollow the current regulations of the International Code on Zoological Nomenclature other status specifications not treated by the ICZN regulations (eg. topotype) have been maintained as supplementary information about the specimen(s) in question.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_ANIMAL_DERIVED"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"catalogUrl":"http://darwin.naturalsciences.be/","preservationTypes":["SAMPLE_DRIED"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"c2bfdeef-9c03-435e-8465-c483dadd6995","mailingAddress":{"key":11315,"address":"patrick.semal@naturalsciences.be, collections@naturalsciences.be ","city":"Bruxelles","postalCode":"1000","country":"BE"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2017-02-06T05:13:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146296,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"25503","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"bca7f17c-a912-487a-84a8-9c2078d3348d","firstName":"Patrick Semal","position":"Head of Patrimonium Directorate","phone":"+3226274380","fax":"+3226274113","email":"Patrick.Semal@naturalsciences.be","mailingAddress":{"key":24591,"city":"Bruxelles","postalCode":"1000","country":"BE"},"primaryInstitutionKey":"c2bfdeef-9c03-435e-8465-c483dadd6995","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2017-02-06T05:09:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"e4b52268-4523-46ba-a196-899036a51b46","code":"UMNH_VZ","name":"Vertebrate Zoology","description":"NHMU Vertebrate Zoology collection houses tens of thousands of specimens for research and educational purposes.

The research collections are maintained in the Biology Building.  The Herpetology Osteological collection consists of about 1200 catalogued entities at present, all dry preparations.  Mostly regional taxa are represented, although a synoptic collection of other U.S. and commonly available non-US species are also present.

The museum&#39;s mission was to document and describe Wyoming&#39;s avian biodiversity. There was a brief period of active collecting by Knight and Charles W. Gilmore in 1897 and 1898. This was followed by a period of inactivity until the arrival of Ernest Pilsbury Walker as an undergraduate. He collected specimens around the southeastern part of the state from 1910 through 1912. He also contributed his personal collection from Sheridan, Indiana. Beyond sporadic trading and salvaging, the collection has been mostly inactive for the past 100 years until Matt Carling was hired as curator and James Maley was hired as collections manager.

Curated specimens form the base for research by Centennial Museum personnel and faculty curators; by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso; and, through loans and visitation, graduate students and professionals from other institutions. The name was changed to UTEP Biodiversity Collections in August of 2012. Collections primarily are of modern and fossil vertebrate biology (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and have a regional emphasis, but also contain material from outside the Southwest, particularly from Mexico. The research collections are maintained in the University of Texas at El Paso Biology Building.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_ANIMAL_DERIVED"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"catalogUrl":"http://arctos.database.museum/home.cfm#UTEP","preservationTypes":["SAMPLE_FLUID_PRESERVED"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"adbcf6bb-4718-4f96-bd4f-cad7116f0d60","mailingAddress":{"key":11236,"address":"500 W.

It currently holds over 100,000 specimens with a worldwide distribution, representing all vertebrate classes from the Silurian to the Pleistocene. This collection was acquired primarily through over a century of field work by section staff and associates as well as acquisitions by the Museum. Fossil collecting began in 1895 with the sponsorship of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who supported the museum&rsquo;s numerous early expeditions to the American West that resulted in one of the best dinosaur collections in the world. Carnegie in his retirement further strengthened the collection with the purchase in 1903 of a large collection of Paleozoic-Cenozoic, European fossils from the Baron de Bayet, a private fossil collector from Brussels, Belgium. Strengths of the collection include Mississippian fishes from Bear Gulch, Montana; Pennsylvanian and Permian fishes, amphibians and reptiles from Pennsylvania, Ohio,  West Virginia and the southwestern United States; Jurassic dinosaurs, especially sauropods, from Utah (Dinosaur National Monument) and Wyoming; Jurassic fishes and reptiles from Germany and France; Eocene fishes from Monte Bolca, Italy; Eocene and Oligocene tetrapods, from Montana, Wyoming and Utah; Miocene mammals from a site now preserved as Agate Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska; and Pleistocene vertebrates from the Appalachian region.","contentTypes":["PALEONTOLOGICAL_TRACE_FOSSILS"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://www.carnegiemnh.org/science/default.aspx?id=17572","apiUrl":"http://www.carnegiemnh.org/","accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"c529f324-701e-45e4-82b7-10587cdb56e8","mailingAddress":{"key":11223,"address":"Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Section of Vertebrate Paleontology, 4400 Forbes Avenue","city":"Pittsburgh","province":"PA","postalCode":"15213","country":"US"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2016-01-14T01:53:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146202,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"24463","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"cf262a42-88bd-4057-a90e-4e336859a2ce","firstName":"Amy Henrici","position":"Collection Manager","areaResponsibility":"Vertebrate fossils","researchPursuits":"Fossil anurans and Late Paleozoic tetrapods.","phone":"412-622-1915","fax":"412-622-8837","email":"henricia@carnegiemnh.org","mailingAddress":{"key":24272,"address":"Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Section of Vertebrate Paleontology, 4400 Forbes Avenue","city":"Pittsburgh","province":"PA","postalCode":"15213-4080","country":"US"},"primaryInstitutionKey":"c529f324-701e-45e4-82b7-10587cdb56e8","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2016-01-14T01:39:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"f2b29a84-4334-454a-bde3-1a8f4bd565e3","code":"LPPNG2012","name":"Laetitia Plaisance PNG Crustacean collection","description":"Crustaceans collected in April 2012 from dead coral heads along a natural pH gradient in Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea","active":true,"personalCollection":true,"mailingAddress":{"key":11427,"city":"Washington","country":"US"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2015-12-07T23:10:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146398,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"24455","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"deddbfd3-2191-4dce-b692-90fcf18a213d","firstName":"Laetitia Plaisance","phone":"2026330684","email":"plaisancel@si.edu","mailingAddress":{"key":24267,"city":"Washington","country":"US"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2015-12-07T23:08:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"a863bed4-4a22-49de-9f47-6ed7296bbf6d","code":"HUCP","name":"Herbário da Universidade Católica do Paraná","description":"The history of the HUCP&rsquo;s had its beginning in the middle of the 1970&rsquo; with the foundation of the Biology Museum, that gathered both botanical and Zoological specimens. In April, 1979 collections where separated and HUCP was founded with preserved specimens of algae (green, red and brown), fungi and embryophytes. On October 2016, the collection encompasses nearly 25,000 specimens from 4,934 species, 1,609 genera and 297 families. Most of the specimens comes from the state of Paran&aacute; but there were also specimens from many Brazilian states and other countries, mainly from South America (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia) but also from other parts of the world (Cuba, USA, Spain, Germany, China and Australia). Our collection includes 135 fungi, 258 gymnosperms, 299 bryophytes, 2725 pteridophytes, 3149 algae, 17832 angiosperms and only one type (Mimosa tucumensis Barneby ex Ribas, M.

Eggs in this collection range in size from the tiny eggs of hummingbirds (0.2 grams) to the gigantic eggs of the extinct elephant bird (9 kilograms). Approximately 80-90% of the specimens are accompanied by original collector data slips and by photographs of sets taken in the museum, both of which are digitally linked to the record online.

Tuomey in the mid 1800s and were used extensively for teaching purposes.  Most of the collection was presumably lost during the Civil War when federal troops destroyed the University of Alabama campus.  Only a few of Tuomey&rsquo;s original &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo; specimens survive in the collections of the Alabama Museum of Natural History and the Geological Survey of Alabama.  \t  \tIn the 1870s, as professor and state geologist, Eugene Allen Smith, directed students on field trips throughout the state where they collected many new specimens and met persons who also contributed to the collections.  \t  \tDr. Dana Ehret is Curator of Paleontology.  \t  \tThe Invertebrate Paleontology Collection is estimated to contain over 20,000 lots of specimens, although only 4,000 are catalogued. Specimens are mainly from the Oligocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous deposits of Alabama. The Paleogene (Eocene plus Oligocene) deposits in Alabama are considered to be among the best in the world.  The Vertebrate Paleontology Collection consists of over 8,000 catalogued items, most of which consist of individual specimens. The collection contains items from the Pennsylvanian, Cretaceous and Paleogene deposits of Alabama, but focuses primarily on Cretaceous and Eocene marine formations. The vertebrate collections have strong representation of Cretaceous mosasaurs, Eocene whales, and Pennsylvanian trackways from the Union Chapel Mine trackway site.  The Paleobotany Collection consists of over 400 specimens catalogued, mostly from the Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous of Alabama, as well as petrified wood from Arizona.","contentTypes":["PALEONTOLOGICAL_INVERTEBRATE_FOSSILS"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://djehret.wix.com/collections","apiUrl":"http://almnh.ua.edu/collections-and-research.html","preservationTypes":["STORAGE_INDOORS"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"63ec8003-3d5a-49ba-b91d-6bfa71c9440b","mailingAddress":{"key":11179,"address":"The University of Alabama Museums, 357 Mary Harmon Bryant Hall, Box 870340","city":"Tuscaloosa","province":"Alabama","postalCode":"35487","country":"US"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2015-04-24T22:16:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146156,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"24272","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[]},{"key":"9c947af9-d3eb-4bf5-9f38-8b7264f6bbb6","code":"CACS","name":"CACS","description":"CACS is a historic institution code associated with the Chicago Academy of Sciences (CHAS,http://grbio.org/cool/v1fg-sphq), mostly in reference to herbarium specimens.

We are making great strides to bring the collection up to modern standards by databasing and reorganizing the collection, curating the specimens, and upgrading the facilities.    However, my primary interests rest with questions pertaining to the evolution and maintenance of orchid diversity. This journey has lead to a series of papers on the relationship between orchids and euglossine bees, the evolution and mechanisms of deception pollination, specificity in orchid-mycorrhizal associations, genetic structure of orchid populations, taxonomy of Caribbean orchids, the biogeography of the West Indies and Orchidaceae, land use history and the local distribution of native specie, and most recently the ecology of naturalized orchids. We are currently studying the reproductive biology and population dynamics of invasive, non-native orchids such as Oeceoclades maculata, Dendrobium crumenatum, Arundina graminifolia and Spathoglottis plicata, and how they may affect populations of native species. In addition, we have begun a study the invasion biology of non-native pines in Puerto Rico and pollination networks in tropical beach dune systems.    The issues I address span taxonomy, evolution, ecology, conservation, and environmental science which means that virtually none of my work has been done without the collaborative efforts of my undergraduate and graduate students, and colleagues within the UPR system and elsewhere.    Although my passion is directed towards the biology of orchids, I encourage my students to work on systems that create passion in their hearts. Some have studied orchids, but others have worked on quite different model systems including Bignoniaceae, Bromeliaceae, Cactaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Myrsinaceae, Pinaceae, Zamiaceae, karst vegetation, plant viruses, rust diseases, invasive species biology and floral fragrances, all asking a variety of ecological and evolutionary questions employing a marvelous array of approaches and tools.","phone":"787) 764-0000 ext. 2023, 2900, 2901, 7558","fax":"(787) 764-3875","email":"ackerman.upr@gmail.com","mailingAddress":{"key":24090,"address":"Department of Biology, University of Puerto Rico, PO Box 23360","city":"San Juan","province":"Puerto Rico","postalCode":"00931","country":"PR"},"primaryInstitutionKey":"4a6f1f3a-e5da-4cc1-bf9d-a5672f807c20","primaryCollectionKey":"dc021441-507a-40b8-a76f-7d3039add5a2","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2014-12-29T09:13:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"633b95ac-f603-41ab-9817-7e567b45ceb1","code":"MNHN","name":"Ornithology","description":"Ornithological collection of Uruguaian avifauna.

The herbarium has important collections from Norway, Iceland, the Arctic (especially Greenland, Jan Mayen, Bear Island, Svalbard, and Novaya Zemlya), Macaronesia, and East Africa (especially Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda). The material includes, e.g., the collections of Mathias Numsen Blytt (1789-1862), S&oslash;ren Christian Sommerfelt (1794-1838), Niels Green Moe (1812-1892), Johannes Mus&aelig;us Norman (1823-1903; part), Bernt Lynge (1884-1942), Eilif Dahl (1916-1993), and Hildur Krog (1922-).  Computerization of the herbarium labels started in September 1994, and by September 2010, all Norwegian and c. 30,000 foreign specimens are recorded. Priority is given to specimens sent out on loan, type material, and Arctic and African material. The database runs on PC&#39;s under DOS, and the data are made available through GBIF-Norway to the data portal at GBIF, Artskart and NLD.  Type material may also the queried through a special service.  To facilitate registration of floristic data, the herbarium runs a field note database (NXL) and a field inventory database. These services are in Norwegian, and the databases use UTM-coordinates (MGRS notation) for localization. On these pages, you may generate registration forms for use in the field, send completed forms to the databases, and perform simple queries. The data are regularily transferred to the three portals mentioned above.  We are happy to present the bibliography databases Recent Literature on Lichens (RLL, covering the period 1951 &ndash; today) and Mattick&#39;s Literature Index (1532 &ndash; 1950) in co-operation with its authors. The databases can be reached through a common search form.  The site also runs the web page for the International Association for Lichenologist&#39;s field meeting in Yunnan, 2002, and the abstract database of the 7th International Mycological Congress, Oslo, 2002.

It contains more than 65,000 specimens in two sub- collections: paleontology and geology (not databased yet). The paleontology collection houses both vertebrate and invertebrate specimens, ranging from Cambrian archaeocyathids to Quaternary mammals. Significantly, it is the largest collection of polar dinosaurs in the world with 10,000 specimens, primarily from the North Slope of Alaska. It also comprises a diverse assortment of Alaskan Quaternary mammals, including a large portion of the material collected throughout Alaska by Otto W. Geist between the late 1920s and the 1960s. The collection also contains a variety of paleobotanical specimens and a large collection of invertebrates (both micro- and macrofossils). It is home to 39 holotypes and 409 paratypes, most of which are invertebrates.

The representation of Minnesota&#39;s flora is unparalleled, with over 170,000 specimens collected throughout Minnesota&rsquo;s history by E. Nielson, O. Lakela, J.W. Moore, W.R. Smith, and many others. The assemblage of historic flora of the Upper Midwest, including the Dakotas, Wisconsin, and southwestern Ontario, is among the best in the U.S. There is an excellent collection of circumboreal and arctic flora due to past research interests of E.C. Abbe, W.S. Cooper, D. Lawrence, and their students. Additionally there is an excellent collection of historic Pacific island flora, through the efforts of J. Tilden, A.A. Heller, and J.W. Moore, as well as a collection of early Amazonian flora by H.H. Rusby and R. Squires as part of the early exploration (1895-1896) of the Orinoco River delta by the Oronoco Company Limited of Minnesota. J.W. Congdon&#39;s collection (over 9,000 specimens) of early California plants (including Yosemite National Park) and approximately 3500 specimens of western US and early tropical Asian flora acquired through J.H. Sandberg&#39;s exchanges are other significant collections.  This section also houses a small collection of paleobotanical specimens spanning the geologic time scale (155 macrofossils and about 75 thin sections).  The fungal collection consists of approximately 100,000 non-lichenized fungi specimens and almost 150,000 specimens of lichenized fungi.  Intensive scientific investigation of Minnesota non-lichenized fungi occurred from about 1885 to 1910, supported by the Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota. Collections made between 1910 and 1960 focused primarily on plant disease fungi. Renewed interest in documenting fleshy fungi began in the 1960s and has expanded in recent years with increased emphasis on the analysis of biodiversity. The following were important collectors who contributed: E.W.D. Holway (rusts of North and South America), M.E. Palm (Minnesota slime molds and fleshy fungi), M.G. Weaver, and D.J. McLaughlin and his students (Minnesota fleshy fungi). There is also an extensive collection of plant pathogenic fungi, especially the Minnesota collections of E.M. Freeman, L.T. Dosdall, and others, and rusts deposited by the U.S.D.A. Cereal Disease Laboratory (St. Paul, MN).  There are also excellent collections of lichenized fungi from the Sonoran Desert region, Minnesota, and national parks and forests (primarily by Clifford Wetmore).  The lichenized fungi also include Bruce Fink&#39;s Minnesota lichens, G. Llano&#39;s collections, and S.K. Harris&#39; New England lichens along with a good representation of the European lichen flora.  Birds and mammals currently comprise over 45,000 birds and 20,000 mammals. In addition to Minnesota vertebrates the Museum also has important holdings of birds and mammals of the Philippines and Borneo (Menage Expedition, 1890-1893) and Mexico (Dickerman and Warner expeditions of the 1960s and 1970s), birds of Peru and Bolivia, and small mammals of the Yucatan &amp; Patagonia (Birney expeditions of the 1970s and 1990s, respectively).  The fish collection currently contains over 45,000 cataloged lots, containing representatives of 142 families, 480 genera, and 1046 species, the majority of which are stored in ethyl alcohol. There is one primary and seven secondary types, including paratypes of the rare Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). The collection dates from the end of the 19th century and contains specimens collected by Ulysses Cox, Henry Nachtrieb, Thaddeus Surber, Samuel Eddy, James Underhill and others. These individuals, their students, and colleagues were responsible for building the collections from the 1890&#39;s to the present. Early collections focused on fishes of the upper Midwest, especially Minnesota. However, significant historical collections include specimens from the Menage expedition to the Philippines in the 1890&#39;s; specimens from Hawaii collected by E.K Jordan in the early 1900&#39;s; and many specimens from the continental United States. Many of the taxa represented in these earlier collections are now rare or endangered. Samuel Eddy, James Underhill, Andrew Simons, and their colleagues and students were responsible for most of the growth of the collections since the 1950&#39;s. The focus of their collections was also on Minnesota and surrounding states, although recent collecting has increased holdings of North American freshwater fishes from the southeastern highlands of the United States. Current accessions include continuing surveys in Minnesota (50%) and the eastern United States (50%). The fish collection also contains diverse holdings of marine fishes from the Pacific Northwest, Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic coast. In addition to the alcoholic collection there is a large collection of pharyngeal teeth from cyprinids (carps and minnows) and catostomids (suckers), a large uncataloged larval fish collection, and a growing collection of dry and cleared-and-stained skeletal material.  The reptile and amphibian collection contains approximately 19,000 specimens and focuses on the upper Midwest. This collection also contains significant collections from Mexico (Regal collections), the southeastern United States, as well as smaller collections from South Pacific islands and southwestern United States. The collection includes representative of 40 families, 152 genera, and 360 species. Among the accessioned material is an extensive series of leopard frogs collected by David Merrell in the 1960s. Merrell&#39;s frogs established a baseline for studying the history of frog malformations in the Upper Midwest. The collection also contains an impressive series of cleared and stained specimens from these studies that were deposited by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.   The invertebrate collection comprises 18,000 lots of mollusks, snails, and crayfish. There is also a small collection of marine specimens that was donated by the Minneapolis Public Library. Recently, the U.S. National Park Service has also begun surveying national park properties within the state and is providing the Museum with its crayfish vouchers. In addition to invertebrates, there is also a small fossil collection (approximately 1000 vertebrate fossils), mainly from Minnesota and Idaho, collected by Robert Bright (Dept. of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior) and his students in the 1970s.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://www.bellmuseum.umn.edu/ResearchandTeaching/Collections/ScientificCollection/index.htm","catalogUrl":"http://www.bellmuseum.umn.edu/ResearchandTeaching/Collections/ScientificCollection/index.htm","preservationTypes":["SAMPLE_DRIED"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"3c35744f-5766-4364-83cb-7e78d366131e","mailingAddress":{"key":11083,"address":"1987 Upper Buford Circle  ","city":"St. Paul","province":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55108","country":"US"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2014-04-30T09:30:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146055,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"23789","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"f5ebc11c-0d91-48b2-9bd4-a5b390ea792b","firstName":"Anita F.

Most of the theses have been supported financially by the BAP Directory of the Y&uuml;z&uuml;nc&uuml; Yıl University.  Rules of the studying in the Insect Collection is compulsorily renewed after the catastrophal earthquakes in Van Province in 2011. The rest of the collection is ruled for the study in the following way:  1. A part of the collection, if currently free to study, is offered to the scientist, who is about to perform a certain scientific publication, under the following conditions:  2. Service delivery is to loan conditionally a certain number of specimens belonging to a certain group of insects to the user, in order to evaluate scientifically for a period of time. Here the number of the specimens that can be borrowed at a time is maximum of 20. Evaluation period of the lent specimens is maximum of two months. Required basic conditions on the lent specimens, being complied, is giving back the preparations (if genitalia prepared necessarily), labelling each specimen if determined, arranging properly the lent specimens in a separate cabinet by the user.  3. Material borrowed cannot be transferred to third parties for any purpose.  4. New material can be borrowed by the same user, after fulfilling the matters specified in Article 2.  5. Based on the lent specimens, if a scientific publication is prepared, the user should mention the repository properly. A copy of the publication should be sent to the Library of the repository.  6.

The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.  The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.  Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.  The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.  Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.  Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).  \t  \tHoldings. The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study &quot;The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,&quot; published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963).  \t  \tFrozen Tissues. We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998. This collection may be searched by choosing the appropriate link from the Data tab, above. The search engine will deliver limited location information.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/collections/herps/","catalogUrl":"http://ellipse.inhs.uiuc.edu:591/INHSCollections/herpsearch.html","preservationTypes":["STORAGE_INDOORS"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"55efe71a-faba-4333-951c-d665509f3d67","mailingAddress":{"key":11043,"address":"Illinois Natural History Survey, 1816 S.

of Amphibians & Reptiles","description":"The Museum of Southwestern Biology (MSB),Division of Amphibians and Reptiles is a centralized repository at the University of New Mexico (UNM) for herpetological specimens. The MSB Division of Amphibians and Reptiles maintains nearly 100,000 specimens, mostly from the Southwestern United States (primarily from New Mexico and surrounding states). The collection also includes substantial numbers of specimens from elsewhere in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean region, the Galapagos Islands, and Vietnam. The division maintains representative skeletal material, a small type collection, and a collection of uncatalogued specimens for teaching purposes. Important collections in the division&rsquo;s holdings are from Big Bend National Park by W.G. Degenhardt and T.L. Brown (all taxa), the Appalachian Plateau by G.B. Wilmott (salamanders), the West Indies by K.L. Jones (leptodactylid frogs), and the Delmarva Peninsula by R. Conant (all taxa). A collection of 5,000 amphibians and reptiles made by William J. Koster formed the basis of the original collection; however,a dramatic increase in holdings occurred with the arrival of William G. Degenhardt in 1960 from Texas A&amp;M University. Through Degenhardt&rsquo;s own collecting efforts and those of his students, the division grew rapidly in size during the 1960&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. Since the late 1980&rsquo;s, the division has become the primary repository for specimens collected as part of expanding research on the State&rsquo;s herpetofauna by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, and continues to receive collections provided by researchers from a variety of state and federal agencies.

About 25 monographs and more than 600 publications are based on this collection. The material has been collected during the past 60 years by professional entomologists and has been deposited from private collections.  \t  Coleoptera. The collection of beetles consists of two main parts: a joint collection of the Institute (ca 35,000 specimens) collected largely from Estonia and a private collection of J. Mil&auml;nder (1900-1992) with 33,971  specimens.  \t  Lepidoptera. A significant part of the collection is formed of the personal collection of W. Petersen (1857-1933) containing both Micro- and Macrolepidoptera from various parts of the Palearctic region (about 55.000 specimens, holotypes of 6 taxa and 15 paratypes).  \t  The personal collection compiled by the amateur lepidopterist R. Suurpere, (12,000 macrolepidopteran specimens) and by R. S&uuml;lla (4,300 specimens) comprises exclusively Estonian material.  \t  The main collection of the Estonian Macrolepidoptera comprises 200,000 mounted and labelled specimens and about 150,000 specimens of unmounted material. Traditionally the butterflies are the most closely investgated insect group. The checklist of Estonian lepidoptera comprises ca 2300 species.  \t  The butterfly collection also contains unique material from insufficiently known regions of the former Soviet Union (the Russian Far East from Kamchatka to Primorye, Siberia, Central Asia, Transcaucasus, etc.) as well as material from Neotropic and Australotropic regions. The collection includes 76 holotypes, 8 lectotype and 463 paratypes.  \t  Diptera. The main part of the collection (ca 140 000) is compiled by K. Elberg and it comprises material from all regions of the former Soviet Union. The  diptera collection includes 19 holotypes, 1 lectotypes, 143 paratypes and 3 allotypes.  \t  Hemiptera. The material was collected by J. Vilbaste (1924 - 1985) and G. Flor (1829-1883). The collection of Homoptera (Auchenorrhyncha) by J.Vilbaste comprises the material from the Altai, Touva, Primorye, Kamtchatka and Sakhalin regions and has served as a basis for faunistic monographs (the manuscript about Sakhalin remained unpublished). A total of 173 holotypes and 2010 paratypes are preserved in this collection, most of them representing the species described by J. Vilbaste himself, a lesser fraction being obtained via exchange.  \t  The systematic collection of spiders (ca 41,000 specimens), compiled by A. Vilbaste (1923-2010), and of ants (ca 80 000 specimens), compiled by V. Maavara (1928 &ndash; 1999), represent all species found in the Estonian territory.  \t  Smaller collection of nematodes compiled by E. Krall (1931-2009) comprises 74 type specimens.  \tFrom IZBE ca 95 000 specimen are linked with Estonian eBiodiversity (http://elurikkus.ut.ee/index.php?lang=eng) database","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://kogud.emu.ee/?do=coll&amp%3Bid=12","preservationTypes":["STORAGE_OTHER"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"ca3714ed-d1af-485e-97ff-5f19be667b29","mailingAddress":{"key":10836,"address":"Kreutzwaldi 5  ","city":"Tartu","province":"not applicable","postalCode":"51014","country":"EE"},"address":{"key":11558,"address":"Kreutzwaldi 5  ","city":"Tartu","province":"not applicable","postalCode":"51014","country":"EE"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2013-04-23T22:28:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":145698,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"4305","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"45835e67-96ee-4832-80fc-953970d24bf5","firstName":"Olavi Kurina","position":"Senior Researcher","researchPursuits":"Systematics, taxonomy and biogeography of Diptera","phone":"+3727311887","email":"olavi.kurina@emu.ee","mailingAddress":{"key":18513,"address":"Kreutzwaldi 5  ","city":"Tartu","postalCode":"51014","country":"EE"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2013-11-07T07:09:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"735ba7d6-9c75-4b8f-82a2-f2bf0f850edf","code":"55","name":"Polyzoniida","description":"Polyzoniid Millipedes","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"preservationTypes":["STORAGE_OTHER"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"65159fdb-cf23-4b8b-9491-e552cfe5a1c8","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2013-04-23T22:28:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":145920,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"4524","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[]},{"key":"7360996e-cc94-4527-9854-4302dbce3996","code":"CRUS.F","name":"Crustacea - Copepoda collection","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://science.naturalis.nl","preservationTypes":["STORAGE_INDOORS"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"0e919a55-08d3-4bd2-aec1-200858fafd92","mailingAddress":{"key":10808,"address":"Postbus 9517  ","city":"Leiden","province":"Zuid-Holland","postalCode":"2300 RA","country":"NL"},"address":{"key":11531,"address":"Darwinweg 2  ","city":"Leiden","province":"Zuid-Holland","postalCode":"2333 CR","country":"NL"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2013-04-23T22:28:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":145660,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"4269","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[]},{"key":"737178bc-2e3d-4e51-ba6c-31203c5c8829","code":"ODO","name":"Odonata","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"preservationTypes":["STORAGE_OTHER"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"22c8fe88-400b-4e8a-92cd-f1c76683f5ba","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2013-04-23T22:28:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":145870,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"4473","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[]},{"key":"7427de7b-f24a-41b0-9831-823539a4ac41","code":"F","name":"Formicidae","description":"Ants.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"preservationTypes":["STORAGE_OTHER"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"2674b136-4e2c-4243-a6de-d7f1eff37163","mailingAddress":{"key":10851,"address":"El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Museo de Zoologia, Av.

The Division of Mammals contains over 250,000 catalogued specimens and is among the 5 largest in the world. Specimens date back to the 1890&#39;s with the majority documenting the rapid environmental change that has occurred since 1950. The collections are taxonomically broad, representing 27 orders, 103 families, 513 genera, ~1,400 species. The majority from the Orders Rodentia (190,000), Chiroptera (25,000), Carnivora (15,000), Soricomorpha (10,000) and Artiodactyla (7,500). The collections are world-wide in scope (72 countries and all 50 US states) with particularly strong holdings from Western North America (150,000 specimens), Beringia and high latitudes (26,000 from Alaska, Russia and Canada), Mongolia (4,200 specimens and parasites), and Latin America (10,200 specimens from Bolivia 7,000 from Chile; 5,000 from Panama). The collection contains 16 holotypes, 6 paratypes, 1 syntype, 93 symbiotypes. Important collections integrated into the MSB include the USGS Biological Surveys collection (26,000), the UIMNH (Hoffmeister) Collection (33,000), Rausch Collection (4,000 specimens and parasites). Specimens range from traditional skin/skull and fluid vouchers to &quot;holistic vouchers&quot; containing skin, skull, post-cranial skeleton, up to seven tissue types (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, muscle, blood), cell suspensions, and ecto and endo parasites. Additionally, frozen tissue samples are available for about 130,000 individual mammals and date back to the late 1970&#39;s. 37,000 specimens have serology data associated with hantavirus surveillance programs in the Americas. The MSB houses an extensive archive of field journals and catalogues that date to the 1900&#39;s and are associated with specimens held in the collection. The collections are growing rapidly through the active research programs of curators, staff and students and ongoing collaborations with other institutions and governmental agencies.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://www.msb.unm.edu/mammals/index.html","catalogUrl":"http://arctos.database.museum/msb_mamm","apiUrl":"http://arctos.database.museum/guid/MSB:Mamm","preservationTypes":["STORAGE_INDOORS"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"8827b228-5892-444f-9ce9-f1e1d97ed133","mailingAddress":{"key":10915,"address":"Museum

The collection includes over 300,000 species representing approximately 60% of known insect families. With specimens from locations worldwide, the collections are second to none in coverage for the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. Specimens from the Old World are also well represented, especially from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. Particular strengths include mosquitoes, wasps, beetles, butterflies and moths, and flies. Although the bulk of the collection is kept dry, various groups&mdash;such as spiders&mdash;are stored in alcohol.   The collections are typically arranged by taxon; lower categories (genus, species) are arranged alphabetically, and for select taxa, they are further organized by country of origin within each species.   While the majority of the collection is housed at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, some groups are held at other research facilities in nearby Maryland, including the USDA Agricutural Research Center&#39;s Systematic Entomology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland and the Smithsonian Institution&#39;s Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_PRESERVED_ORGANISMS"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"homepage":"http://entomology.si.edu/Collections.html","catalogUrl":"http://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/ento/","preservationTypes":["SAMPLE_DRIED"],"accessionStatus":"INSTITUTIONAL","institutionKey":"586ee56e-b0fe-4dff-b7f9-aeb104f3308a","mailingAddress":{"key":10839,"address":"P.O.

Also the collection contains significant historical collections of importance: James Henry Fleming, James A. Munro, Hoyes Lloyd, part of the Haverschmidt collection from the Guyanas, R. G. Lanning, H.B. Haugh collection of birds eggs from Southern Ontario. The Fleming collection, once considered the most comprehensive private collection of birds in North America, contains many unique collections from Africa, Europe, India, China, and Island Archipelagos of the world. Representative collections of the magnificent Birds of Paradise (Passeriformes; Paradisaeidae) and Bower Birds (Passeriformes; Ptilonorhynchidae) (from the Fleming Collection) has been described as within the top 10 in world by researchers. Sub-collections of the J.H. Fleming, J.A. Munro collections are considered historically significant to the Ornithological community. Other significant collections are The New World Sparrows (Passeriformes: Emberizidae); the North American Wood Warblers (Passeriformes: Parulidae); Shorebirds, Gulls and Auks (Charadriiformes) and the Chicken-like birds (Galliformes) of North America, New World Vireos and Allies (Passeriformes: Vireonidae). The study skin collection contains one of the largest collections in the world of extinct birds including 132 Passenger Pigeon specimens (skins) and New Zealand Huias famed for their sexually dimorphic bills. 1 specimen of the extinct Labrador Duck (1 of 54 mounted skins in world). 1 specimen of the extinct Great Auk (1 of 78 mounted skins in world), miscellaneous skeletal parts of Great Auk specimens, 14 specimens of the extinct Carolina Parakeet and many other species. The skin collection contains historically significant holdings of the highly endangered Hawaiian Honeycreepers (Passeriformes: Fringillidae Drepanididae) from the Fleming collection, 1840s through to 1913, and the famous Darwin’s finches. The frozen tissue collection contains the largest collection of blood and DNA from endangered kiwi populations in New Zealand, as well as bone shavings and DNA from the 14 extinct species of giant moas.

Janzen and Winnie Hallwachs at University of Pennsylvania","description":"Database of adult moths, butterflies, caterpillars, and their parasitoids, from Area de Conservacion (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica.    University of Pennsylvania is only a clearing house.  All specimens are in slow or fast transit for donation to to public institutional collections.  To know which is going where, contact us at djanzen@sas.upenn.edu and whallwac@sas.upenn.edu.   Primary specimen recipients are American Museum of Natural History, Monell Cryofacility (New York, N. Y.), National Museum of Natural History (Washington,D.C.), American Entomological Institute (Gainesville, Florida), McGuire Biodiversity Center (Gainesville, Florida), Canadian National Collection (Ottawa, Ontario), INBio (Santo Domingo de Heredia, Costa Rica), and others.    Specimens are either oven dried (pinned, spread, mounted) in the field in ACG in Costa Rica, or preserved in 95% ETOH and refrigerated or frozen (-20C) until later processing and deposition in an institutional collection.    Caterpillars and wild-caught adult Lepidoptera are individually voucher coded with a voucher code of the kind yy-SRNP-x to yy-SRNP-xxxxx if reared, or yy-SRNP-xxxxxx if wild-caught.  If parasites reared from a SRNP voucher, the parasite receives also its own individual voucher code of the format DHJPARxxxxxxx (though if it was a lot reared from one caterpillar, only the individuals selected from that lot for individual treatment receive the DHJPARxxxxxxx individual code.  It is hoped that the SRNP and DHJPAR acronyms will not be used by other collections to distinguish their voucher codes from others.","contentTypes":["BIOLOGICAL_OTHER"],"active":true,"personalCollection":true,"homepage":"http://janzen.sas.upenn.edu/caterpillars/database.lasso","catalogUrl":"http://janzen.sas.upenn.edu/caterpillars/database.lasso","apiUrl":"http://janzen.sas.upenn.edu/caterpillars/database.lasso","preservationTypes":["STORAGE_OTHER"],"mailingAddress":{"key":11399,"address":"Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, 3740 Hamilton Walk","city":"Philadelphia","province":"PA","postalCode":"19104-6018","country":"US"},"address":{"key":11869,"address":"Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, 3740 Hamilton Walk","city":"Philadelphia","province":"PA","postalCode":"19104-6018","country":"US"},"createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2013-04-11T00:59:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000","tags":[],"identifiers":[{"key":146057,"type":"GRBIO_ID","identifier":"1421","createdBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}],"contacts":[{"key":"20b6b565-9e2c-47f3-b57a-596a9f0185a6","firstName":"Daniel Janzen","phone":"215-898-5636","email":"djanzen@sas.upenn.edu","primaryInstitutionKey":"660f56b2-2139-488c-b907-17fb928dd01f","createdBy":"GRBIO","modifiedBy":"registry-migration-grbio.gbif.org","created":"2013-04-12T09:38:00.000+0000","modified":"2018-11-15T10:23:01.527+0000"}]},{"key":"a7344e6c-a163-47b1-a124-f7a555e1a507","code":"RCDP","name":"Robert C.
